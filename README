Project description: Create a game in SDL with AI that reacts to you.

The easiest part of this project: Very little was easy because I can be dumb

Problems that I had in completing this project: Mostly everything was hard
because I can be dumb

A few sentences describing my proposed project: 
	Tile based turn based combat with an indeterminate number of players / 
	AI. Items are on the battlefield, and can be picked up to deal damage.
	Walkable / Impassable tiles.
