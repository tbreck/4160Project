Project description: Add an Object Pool, Explosions, Projectiles,
                     Sound and Music.

The easiest part of this project: The easiest part was the object pool.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Getting the music to work correctly was a bit of a challenge. We ended up using .ogg files because they
    work as well as the .wav and they are much smaller file sizes. Another issue that we had was the getting the HUD to appear correctly which was
    helped solve during office hours.

Where did I get my Sound and Music? Colt made the music and the sound effects himself. The only sound that we did copy is the death sound which is the
    'oof' death sound from Roblox. (Just because it is such a great sound)

What Objects did I pool? The two players, the 6 crates, and then the items that are held after picking up a crate.

Notes:
- All graphics were custom made
- Yes, we really tried to do things differently
- Because of the last bullet, our code has resulted into a lot of "Hacky" code (sorry), but it got the job done
- In the XML, the map is fully customizable to be whatever you want it to be (There's a tile legend above it)
